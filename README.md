# Data Cleaning Python

## Project Overview

This project was my first time working with python code, so i decided to flex my data cleaning skill this time using python. It was abit tough, but with the aid of YouTube and google, i saw the end of it. By the way, i got a project where i used SQL to clean data. You can check that out [here]()

## Data Overview

This dataset contains information on customers and their choice on being called. I got the dataset from a YouTuber's Github repository. I am not sure if it is okay to tag him, but he was a good tutor and i learnt a lot from him.
